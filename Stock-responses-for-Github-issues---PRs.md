## "Please assign me this issue"

```
Thanks for your interest @...! You are welcome to work on this. We do not assign issues outside of the core team - we just ask that people indicate their intention to work on an issue (as you have now done), to avoid duplicating efforts.

For further help in getting started, please see https://dev.to/lb/ten-tasty-ingredients-for-a-delicious-pull-request-hgc - you may also wish to join [our #new-contributors channel on Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).

## No steps to reproduce
```
Hi @... - thanks for the report. Unfortunately this doesn't give us enough information to investigate the issue - we need to know specific steps that will reproduce this error starting from a fresh Wagtail instance. Without these there's no way for us to tell if this is really a bug in Wagtail, some other component of your project, or user error.

If you're able to replicate this bug on a newly-created Wagtail project, please open a new issue, being sure to fill in all of the details as requested on the issue template.

If you need help troubleshooting an issue that occurs on your existing project, you may be able to get assistance on [our support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html).
