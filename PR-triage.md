Here are links to the various bottlenecks of the contribution funnel, which core team members can use to unblock contributions. All of the filters below are built with `is:pr is:open sort:updated-desc draft:false` as a baseline. This usage of filters assumes PRs are triaged properly â€“ if anything is amiss feel free to relabel / change the milestone.

## Needs triage

This queue should be easy to empty (ðŸ˜‰). Take the time to label PRs according to the component they touch, their type, status. This is also a good time to make a first comment on the PR to thank the contributor, and flag anything obviously amiss with the PR â€“ absence of description of the changes (or screenshots?), missing documentation updates or tests, broken tests in CI. PRs with `WIP` in the title can be converted to drafts.

[`no:label`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+no%3Alabel+draft%3Afalse)

## Ready to merge?

This either can be merged, or needs to be relabeled.

[`review:approved -label:"status:Needs Review" -label:"status:Needs Work"`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+review%3Aapproved+-label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Review%22+-label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Work%22)

## Design decision needed

We should aim to have this empty, as those PRs either need confirmation to go ahead, or should be closed to get a complete re-implementation. However it requires at least two core team members to meaningfully decide on these.

[`label:"status:Needs Design Decision"`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Design+Decision%22+)

## Needs review

The PR needs a review. Depending on the state of the PR it might be helpful for it to get a first high-level "diff looks good to me" review, or more in-depth "checkout locally and poke at it" review.

[`label:"status:Needs Review" -label:"status:Needs Design Decision"`](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+draft%3Afalse+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Review%22+-label%3A%22status%3ANeeds+Design+Decision%22+)

### Reviewers

PRs that are ready for review should be assigned to a reviewer. The following list of people who volunteer to be assigned for review of new PRs. Please check this list regularly as reviewers can add and remove themselves based on their current capacity:

 - Matt Westcott @gasman
 - Jacob Topp-Mugglestone @jacobtoppm
 - Coen van der Kamp @allcaps
 - Dan Braghis @zerolab

Note: If you don't know the best person for the review, feel free to assign a random person. The reviewer is responsible for either reviewing the PR or passing it on to someone else on the list.
