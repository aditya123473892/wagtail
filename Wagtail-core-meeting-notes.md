### Discussions

#### Public meeting notes

Starting 29.06.2016 we will share meeting notes. We decided to start on Github wiki page, but probably we will move them into separate repo and will create pull requests for discussions (something like [reactjs/core-notes](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes)).

#### Wagtail 1.6rc1 and 1.7rc1 release dates
* 1.6 - August 1st
* 1.7 - October 1st

#### Release process

* Wagtail now uses 8 week release cycles for feature releases.
    * 6 weeks - Development phase
    * 2 weeks - RC phase
* Create stable branch at the start of the RC phase
    * `master` branch can receive new features, to be released in the following cycle
*  Development of a new version can begin during RC phase (if there's nothing more important to deal with in the RC) and won't count towards the 8 weeks
* RCs always come on the 1st of the even months

#### Draft.js
