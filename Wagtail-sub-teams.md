Sub teams supplement the Wagtail [core team](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Wagtail-core-team) with more diverse teams focused on specific areas, each led by a member of the core team.

## Current teams

Here are our currently active sub teams.

### Accessibility

The accessibility team focuses on improvements to the [accessibility of Wagtail](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/contributing/developing.html#accessibility-targets), and of [websites built with Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6090). Everyone is welcome regardless of skill level or background. Find us on the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#accessibility](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/CB7L6L5S6).

We meet every two weeks to discuss our work (time TBC depending on participantsâ€™ timezones) â€“ 30min chat, discuss each othersâ€™ progress, take actions.
