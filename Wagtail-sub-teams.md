## Accessibility

The accessibility team focuses on improvements to the [accessibility of Wagtail](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/contributing/developing.html#accessibility-targets), and of [websites built with Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6090). Everyone is welcome regardless of skill level or background. Find us on the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#accessibility](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/CB7L6L5S6).

We meet every two weeks to discuss our work (time TBC depending on participants) – 30min chat, discuss each others’ progress, take actions.

## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of the Wagtail open source project. It helps people get started, and  explains how to use Wagtail. Improving the documentation is the mission of the documentation team.

Some long term goals are:

- Reorganise the documentation into clear sections.
- Move the user guide into a seperate project.
- Start supporting translations.
Please join the Documentation team. [#documentation](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C0152QK6PC6) on [Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).
