## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of the Wagtail open source project. It helps people get started, and explains how to use Wagtail. Improving the documentation is the mission of the documentation team.

Some long term goals are:

- Reorganise the documentation into clear sections.
- Move the user guide into a seperate project.
- Start supporting translations.
Please join the Documentation team. [#documentation](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C0152QK6PC6) on [Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).
