The accessibility team focuses on improvements to the [accessibility of Wagtail](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/contributing/developing.html#accessibility-targets), and of [websites built with Wagtail](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/latest/advanced_topics/accessibility_considerations.html). Everyone is welcome regardless of skill level or background. Find us on the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) in [#accessibility](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/CB7L6L5S6).

## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial part of the Wagtail open source project. It helps people get started, and explains how to use Wagtail. Improving the documentation is the mission of the documentation team.

Some long term goals are:

- Reorganise the documentation into clear sections.
- Move the user guide into a separate project.
- Start supporting translations.
Please join the Documentation team. [#documentation](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C0152QK6PC6) on [Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).

## Performance

This team will focus on measurement and optimisation of both backend (admin, API and template responses) and front-end, with the goal of demonstrably improved performance on each release.

Please join the #performance-working-group team on [Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).
