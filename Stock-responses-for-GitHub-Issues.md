## No steps to reproduce
```
Hi @... - thanks for the report. Unfortunately this doesn't give us enough information to investigate the issue - we need to know specific steps that will reproduce this error starting from a fresh Wagtail instance. Without these there's no way for us to tell if this is really a bug in Wagtail, some other component of your project, or user error.

If you're able to replicate this bug on a newly-created Wagtail project, please open a new issue, being sure to fill in all of the details as requested on the issue template.

If you need help troubleshooting an issue that occurs on your existing project, you may be able to get assistance on [our support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html).

## Steps to reproduce provided but seem suspicious

```
Thanks for the report, @. Just to confirm: have you been able to reproduce this error by following the 'Steps to Reproduce' on a completely new site created with `wagtail start my_project`, or does it only occur on your existing project? (Often, we find that errors like this are caused by something the developer has previously done on their project, such as deleting a page model - in this case, we need to know the full sequence of events before we can investigate.)
```

## Unable to replicate

```
Thanks for the report @...! However, I'm unable to replicate this issue as described. I followed these steps, starting from a fresh Wagtail instance:

I'll close this for now, but if you can provide a set of steps that reproduce the problem, we'll be happy to reopen and investigate further.
```

## No response to "needs info"
```
I'll close this issue for now, as we need more details before we can investigate further - we'll be happy to reopen if you can provide the requested info. Thanks!
