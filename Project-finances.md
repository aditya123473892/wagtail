## Open Collective and Open Source Collective

We manage the Wagtail project’s finances [on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/wagtail), a platform for open source projects to manage their budgets transparently. Our _fiscal host_ is [Open Source Collective](https://docs.oscollective.org/). They hold Wagtail’s funds on our behalf in exchange for a fee on all income we receive. Our organization admins approve or reject expenses and invoices as needed.

<!-- Keep track of major financial transactions here, from most to least recent. -->
