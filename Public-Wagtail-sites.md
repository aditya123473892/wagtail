In the future we hope to create a testimonial-cum-directory site, listing both agencies offering wagtail and the sites launched on it. To start that list we'd really like to hear from anyone who has *launched* a publicly viewable site on Wagtail.

## How can I help?

Using a new bullet in the list below, please give

1. the URL of the site, 
2. who it was developed by and 
3. an approximate town/country of the developer e.g, "Oxford UK", or simply "NZ" etc.

(Obviously only add your site if you're happy for it to be listing publicly. If you're unhappy giving a part of this information, just skip it.)
