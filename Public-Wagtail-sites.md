In the future we hope to create a testimonial/directory site, listing both agencies offering wagtail and the sites launched on it. To start that list we'd really like to hear from anyone who has *launched* a *public* site on Wagtail.

## Add your site

Edit this wiki page and using a new bullet in the "Site list" below, please give

1. the URL of the site, 
2. (optional) who it was developed by and 
3. (even more optional) an approximate town/country of the developer e.g, "Oxford UK", "NZ" etc.

(Obviously only add your site if you're happy for it to be listing publicly.)
