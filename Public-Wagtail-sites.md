Using a new bullet, please provide the URL of the site, who it was developed by and an approximate town/country of the developer e.g, "Oxford UK", or simply "NZ" etc.

In the future we hope to create a testimonial-cum-directory site, listing both agencies offering wagtail and the sites launched on it.

(Obviously, please only add your site if you're happy for it to be listing publicly. If you're unhappy giving your location just skip that bit.)
