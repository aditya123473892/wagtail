## About Wagtail

Wagtail is a popular content management system. It's built on Python, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world.

Like Python and Django, the technologies which underpin it, Wagtail is known for its welcoming community. We're keen to increase the geographic and cultural diversity of our core team, who are currently spread across Europe, Africa and North America. We seek to offer friendly support on Slack, StackOverflow and Github, and we encourage the community to meet in real life where possible, with recent sprints and conferences held in South Africa, Iceland, the USA, Belarus and the UK.

Wagtail has moved fast in the last few years, with particular focus on the editor experience, the refinement of APIs for headless CMS architectures and accessibility. We have adopted a regular quarterly release cycle, which aims to minimise upgrade time while providing compelling new features and improvements with each point releases. We're seeking help to deliver some of our more ambitious plans, many of which are expressed as [RFCs]. We're also open to your ideas for making Wagtail the best open source CMS for the 2020s!

## Contributors

GSoC is an activity that a contributor (participant) performs as an independent developer. Contributors get a stipend from Google. 

Wagtail contributors should:

- Have a good understanding of how GSoC works. Read [Contributor advice](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice), [Contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) and [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).
- Have a basic familiarity with Python, Django and Git.
- Go through the [Wagtail tutorial](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). Let us know if you encounter blockers.
- Create a [development environment](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/developing.html) for working on Wagtail. There are good instructions in our [official documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/index.html).
- Join [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) and introduce yourself on the [#gsoc](https://wagtailcms.slack.com/archives/CTL4SFX29) channel.
- Get to know the Wagtail community. Consider contributing to Wagtail already. Show that you understand how open-source projects work.
- Invest time to discover what project fits you.
- Try to contribute to the project discussion.

### Improve your chances of being accepted

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as a Wagtail GSoC contributor is to start contributing now. Make yourself known to the community for your contributions. Try to contribute to an area related to your proposal. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're looking for candidates who can demonstrate that they can engage in the Wagtail project. We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the submissions process are the best way to demonstrate this.

## Organisation admins

Dawn Wages and Thibaud Colas are Wagtail organisation admins. They oversee mentors, contributors, and are the point of contact for Google.

To contact Dawn and Thibaud, direct message them on [Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) @dawn and @Thibaud.


## Mentors

If you're interested in mentoring -- supervising a contributor in work on Wagtail-related activities -- let us know by direct messaging the [organisation admins](#organisation-admins).

## Project ideas

### Project proposal

Your proposal should:

- Have a concrete task.
- Give a solid idea of what will constitute success. You tell us.
- Present a detailed design specification.
- Give insight into who you are. If you propose something ambitious, convince us that you are up to the task.
- Give insight into your previous projects and experience.
- Tell us about your experience with Python/Django/Wagtail.
- Provide a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones.
- Contain your motivation and curriculum vitae.

Here is an example of [an accepted proposal](https://gist.github.com/chrismedrela/82cbda8d2a78a280a129).

Note:

- The project ideas below are starting points for your submission, but aren’t enough by themselves. You’ll need to come up with a more complete project plan, and use your own words.
- Do not feel limited to the project ideas below.
- If you have a project idea not listed, please direct message the [organisation admins](#organisation-admins). They can test the project eligibility and pair you with a mentor for initial feedback.

Project proposals should fall into one of three categories:

- Work on Wagtail itself. The core product.
- Work on tools to support Wagtail. Example: Editor guide as a Wagtail website.
- Wagtail third-party libraries. Example: [Wagtail Live](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live) is a GSOC 2021 project.

The project you propose should be:

- Something useful for the Wagtail project
- A single well-scoped project
- Achievable within the time of GSoC
- And something the core developers can help mentor you on.

Contribution guidelines:

- The [code of conduct](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to all contributors.
- The [contribution guidelines](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/contributing/index.html#) apply to all contributions.
