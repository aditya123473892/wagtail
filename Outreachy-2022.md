## About Wagtail

Wagtail is a popular content management system. It's built on Python, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world.

Like Python and Django, the technologies which underpin it, Wagtail is known for its welcoming community. We're keen to increase the geographic and cultural diversity of our core team, who are currently spread across Europe, Africa and North America. We seek to offer friendly support on Slack, StackOverflow and Github, and we encourage the community to meet in real life where possible, with recent sprints and conferences held in South Africa, Iceland, the USA, Belarus and the UK.

Wagtail has moved fast in the last few years, with particular focus on the editor experience, the refinement of APIs for headless CMS architectures and accessibility. We have adopted a regular quarterly release cycle, which aims to minimise upgrade time while providing compelling new features and improvements with each point releases. We're seeking help to deliver some of our more ambitious plans, many of which are expressed as [RFCs]. We're also open to your ideas for making Wagtail the best open source CMS for the 2020s!

## Contributors

### Contributor initial checklist

All candidate Outreachy contributors should:

1. [ ] Have a good understanding of how Outreachy works.
2. [ ] Join the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack) and introduce yourself on the #new-contributors channel. Let us know a bit about you (what you’re comfortable with!), skills you have and skills you want to practice, which projects you’re interested in.
3. [ ] Invest time to discover what project(s) you like.
4. [ ] Ask questions about the project(s) you are interested in.
5. [ ] Get to know the Wagtail community.
6. [ ] Make small contributions to Wagtail already. Show that you understand how open-source projects work. This can be all sorts of different kinds of tasks – helping orient people on Slack, identifying problems with Wagtail, our documentation. Making changes to the code, documentation, translation, etc.

### Documentation contributors

For people interested in contributing to project 2 _"Improve user guide documentation for Wagtail"_, we expect you to go through the following initial tasks as part of getting up to speed with Wagtail as a community:

### Code contributors

For people interested in contributing to projects 1 or 3 – _"Develop tools to help Wagtail editors create accessible content"_, _"Introduce Stimulus for interactive widgets within Wagtail"_, we expect you to go through the following tasks:

- [ ] Confirm you have a basic familiarity with Git and GitHub.
- [ ] Go through the [Wagtail tutorial](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html). Let us know if you encounter blockers.
- [ ] Create a [development environment](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/developing.html) for working on Wagtail. There are good instructions in our [official documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/index.html).

### Improve your chances of being accepted

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as an Outreachy contributor with Wagtail is to start contributing now. Make yourself known to the community for your contributions. Try to contribute to an area related to your proposal. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're looking for candidates who can demonstrate that they can engage in the Wagtail project. We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the submissions process are the best way to demonstrate this.

### Your first contribution

- [ ] I have read and been through the [contributor checklist](#contributor-checklist)
- [ ] I have identified a good first task, either on my own, or one of the [good first issues](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), or one tagged [Outreachy](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3AOutreachy), or looking at [5 simple ways anyone can contribute to Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/blog/5-simple-ways-anyone-can-contribute-to-wagtail/)
