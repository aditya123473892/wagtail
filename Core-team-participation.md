Core team members may be volunteers, or may have varying priorities at work which make regular commitments difficult. Taking this into account, we suggest the following minimum levels of participation:

 - joining at least one meeting a month
 - let the team know that you can't attend a meeting, by declining the calendar invitation or posting to #core-team
 - on a fortnightly basis, at least one of:
   - submitting a PR (to any repo in the Wagtail organisation)
   - answering a question on Stack Overflow
   - reviewing a PR
   - triaging 5 issues
   - supporting a user on Slack
   - blogging about Wagtail
