# Collections

## Introduction

'Collections' (name TBC) are a concept for organising images, documents and potential future entities into logical, non-hierarchical groups. This is expected to be particularly useful for multi-site implementations, and should support the following scenarios:

- A user in group 'Site X editors' can use, add, edit and delete images from 'Collection X' and 'Global Collection' but not 'Collection Y'.
- A user in group 'Site Y editors' can use images in 'Collection X' and 'Global Collection', but can only add, edit or delete images in 'Collection Y'.
- A user in 'Site Z editors' can only see and use images in 'Collection Z'.

## Notes

- Edit and delete permissions are not distinguished
