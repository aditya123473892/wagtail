**Please follow [Wagtail’s security policy](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/policy) when contacting this team**. For security discussions that aren’t related to vulnerabilities, find us in [#security](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C015Y7T4MQR) on the [Wagtail Slack](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).

## Team charter

The security team’s membership is restricted, as we discuss sensitive issues such as [0-day vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) in Wagtail. Membership is on invitation only, with an indefinite term revokable at any point.

We meet as-needed only. The team organises the response to security vulnerability reports in private channels according to [Wagtail’s security policy (SECURITY.md)](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/policy), and uses [#security](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C015Y7T4MQR) for discussions which aren’t deemed sensitive.
