## Team charter

The security team’s membership is restricted, as we regularly discuss sensitive issues such as [0-day vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_(computing)) in Wagtail. Membership is on invitation only, with an indefinite term which can be revoked at any point.

We meet as-needed only. The team organises the response to security vulnerability reports in private channels, and uses [#security](https://app.slack.com/client/T0K33F93J/C015Y7T4MQR) for discussions which aren’t deemed sensitive.
