Attendees: Thibaud, Naomi, Scott, LB, Harris

### Actions

- Thibaud - Prepare a PR on wagtail-fork for the proposed percy checks (Scott can review, Naomi happy to review the Pull Request side of things to see how that can work for others).

### Actions review

- ✅ Thibaud Do another search on GitHub for Hallo packages
- ✅ Thibaud Review structured docstrings research
- ✅Steve, Thibaud - To propose visual regression testing soon
  - Percy from Browserstack, Storybook test suite, E2E test suite

### Discussions

- Hallo packages
  - Should not be a huge issue, not too many packages out there.
- Structured docstrings research
  - The most simple is probably the best way to go, the plan is to take a look in the next day or so.
  - Need a volunteer to review a PR when ready (Scott will do)
- Slack channel: #ui vs. #ui-team, or both
  - Naomi - Would be good to split the channel out, but splitting out makes it harder for the wider community to feel that they can input.
  - Sometimes the channel can be filled up with a bit of logistics but this is probably not a big deal and can be managed with a thread.
  - Agreed - no change for now but just a reminder for everyone that we do want to be transparent with the community but also try to keep noise to a minimum (use threads).
- [Third-party libraries selection for major UI components #7980](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7980)
  - Looking for feedback / more suggestions before we proceed.
  - Thibaud - the only one we need really soon is the tooltip, the others are futher down the line.
    - The datepicker choice is actually really hard, there is not an option we could find that was actually accessible and supports our requirements for assistive text.
  - Naomi - best to go with what is the most 'default' as possible (Pythonic way), especially when all the other options are not great, we can go with the default and then can always adopt something more in the future.
  - Tippy.js - seems good for accessibility and is actually a layer on top of floating-ui (aka popper.js).
  - Looking for suggestions for any others, including tabs.
  - Would be good to see what other large organisations (governments) are using for these kinds of things.
  - Possibly useful tab guidance: <https://inclusive-components.design/tabbed-interfaces/>
- Documentation for components -- will do a trial next
  - Looking for volunteers
  - See actions, looking at the simplest approach to get started.
- Visual regression testing setup: with [Percy](https://percy.io/) from Browserstack
  - For every PR, via existing CircleCI builds
  - Running both on Storybook stories, and integration tests with Puppeteer
    - Running multiple "projects" is [documented](https://docs.percy.io/docs/multiple-projects-per-repo)
  - GitHub [PR status](https://docs.percy.io/docs/github)
    - Do not require Percy approvals
  - Set to [auto-approve where relevant](https://docs.percy.io/docs/approval-workflows)
  - Next steps: trial all of the above on [wagtail-fork](https://github.com/thibaudcolas/wagtail-fork) project, incl. PR workflow
  - Looking for volunteers to review
  - Scott has a little bit of experience with Percy and is happy to take a look
  - Naomi is happy to review the Pull Request side of things to see how that can work for others.
- SVG icons
  - Rollout is nearly there: <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/6107>, <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7511>
  - There is a list on github (about 40 or so) of existing icons that still need to be addressed.
  - Would be a great time to finish this off before the next release if possible.
  - Table headers (sort by), these have been a bit tricky, most others should be reasonably straightforward.
  - Scott is happy to take another look at these.
- Core team updates
  - Naomi raised (in core team) that it would be good for sub-teams to have a standing update slot in core team meetings (or once a month).
  - Maybe the highlights (decisions, main items) as a short summary.
  - Short updates in the core team chat are also useful.

## 2022-03-03 UTC morning

Attendees: LB, Thibaud

### Actions

- ✅ Thibaud Do another search on GitHub for Hallo packages
- Thibaud Review structured docstrings research
- Thibaud Prototype comment extraction with Markdown syntax -- simplest option (w/ Markdown MIME type)
- Steve, Thibaud - To propose visual regression testing soon
  - Percy from Browserstack, Storybook test suite, E2E test suite
- Thibaud Compare different approaches to UI component declarations

### Actions review

- ✅ Thibaud Review <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8017>
- ✅ Thibaud - Invite Ben Enright to our future meetings.
- ✅ Coen Raise PO files methodology & blocktrans trimmed issue
- Steve, Thibaud - To propose visual regression testing soon
  - Percy from Browserstack, Storybook test suite, E2E test suite
- ✅ Naomi Research structured docstrings
  - From the [sphinx.ext.autodoc documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html), there are two other styles for docstrings, which are described well in the [sphinx.ext.napoleon documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html#module-sphinx.ext.napoleon) (which converts them to RST for autodoc. Of those three options (autodoc, NumPy, Google) I like the [Google style](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings), which is more similar to the Markdown style that Thibaud showed. I wonder if it would be possible to use [napoleon's docstring parsing](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/4.x/sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py) both for linting and to output something other than RST, but my guess would be that it's more trouble than it's worth? It also does not include a way to give default values for arguments.
  - YAML seems like it could be a good option since it's JSON based, so it would convert easily to what Storybook wants. Though at some point it feels like what's the difference between doing this and just shoving the whole story config into the template file.
- Thibaud Compare different approaches to UI component declarations

### Discussions

- Should we find all Hallo packages - add an issue flagging that next release Hallo will be an external package?
  - Only one found so far with dual editor support
  - Will check again
- When will we formalise that the next release will be 3.0? (release notes file, communication, references in external packages)
  - Soon™ (discussed in this week's team meeting)
  - wagtail-hallo: will have to fix the core packages reorganisation, hopefully will be picked up by nightly CI
  - v0.1.0 for 2.16, v0.2.0 for 3.0
- Structured docstrings
  - Keep it simple?
  - Comments syntax lighting
  - `{% comment "Optional note" %}` <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/#comment>

### Discussions

- Actions review
  - ✅ Steve - Follow up with ben about multilingual (test and see if the browser can translate too).
  - Doesn't work so well in Figma
  - ✅ LB, Steve - Research how to test multilingual issues in the wild and follow up with the slack channel. Done <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8017> - lots of research results there, nothing that stands out as a solution but rather lots of smaller things we can adopt.
  - Thibaud - Invite Ben to our future meetings.
  - Coen Raise PO files methodology & blocktrans trimmed issue
  - Thibaud Implement auto-fixable ordering of declaration blocks in CSS
  - Steve, Thibaud - To propose visual regression testing soon

  - Aiming to make a tentative decision within the next month for a UI framework decision and component level [(Dropdown, Tabs, Modal, Tooltips, Datepicker)](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/7980)
- Internationalisation testing / guidelines
  - <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8017>
  - <https://rtlstyling.com/posts/rtl-styling>
- Pattern library setup demo ([#8025](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/pull/8025))
- UI components file structure
- UI components documentation
- Storybook it? Documentation table is one of the main benefits
- Example: changing what buttons look like vs. reusing a template -- do we expect people to be able / willing to Storybook this?
- Brand new views with existing components vs. brand new components
- Structured comment format -- YAML
- Amazing bonus points:
  - Check file for variables that are used, check comments, throw errors
  - Custom comment tag with syntax highlighting & formatting
  - Python documentation for functions
- Standardised format for docstring / triple-quote comments
  - Yeah docstring not inherently very structured <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>
  - Sphinx is a system that auto documents python functions and is fairly standard, so this is a place I would start looking <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html>
- UI components API
  - {% icon name="potato" %}
  - [django-components](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/django-components/) -- Reusable UI components for Django, going further than template partials.
  - [django-component](https://gitlab.com/Mojeer/django_components) -- Modern components for django templates Declarative and composable components inspired by javascript frameworks.
  - [slippers](https://github.com/mixxorz/slippers) -- Reusable components for Django, without writing a single line of Python.
  - Custom implementation
  - Depends on contributors' backgrounds? One more thing to learn?
  - How much do those libraries bring?
  - Custom template tags generally -- can be annoying to have to figure out how the template tags work
- Wagtail Space US
  - Harris join organizers? ;)
  - Dawn interested to help new contributors -- particularly around UI work
    - Suggestions welcome!

    - > The version we're using is very old and rather different from the current one, but the current one looks reasonable. I (Naomi) think we should update to the current version, but either we'll have to test well since some things are affirmatively different (like going from b and strong having font-weight: bold to having font-weight: bolder). I agree with Normalize's approach of not being opinionated. I think that if we want something opinionated, we should go with using an entire accessibility-focused design system such as [uswds](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), which I've never used before, but they're legally required to be serious about accessibility.
    - Potential breakage? (this is good timing if there is any)
    - Decision needed: introduce this side by side with supporting existing CSS / UI components? Or separate
