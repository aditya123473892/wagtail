### Do I need to ask for permission to work on an issue?

No. However, check if there is an existing pull request (PR). If there is nothing, you can optionally add a comment mentioning that you're starting work on it.

### Where can I find more information about setting up?

See the [Contributing](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/contributing/index.html) section of the Wagtail documentation.

### What should I include in my pull requests

0. The fix or feature you are working on
1. Tests
2. Linted code (we make use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). You can run all formatting with `make format`)
3. Updated documentation where relevant (e.g. when adding a new feature)
